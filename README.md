# GameDevProject1
This is for the Game Dev class. Mark Johnson and Ethan Thomas.


Evaluation:
Name of Game: MineCat
Intent of Game: To catch falling diamonds
Narrative Structure: The miner cat's diamonds are carelessly falling from the sky! Help the ground floor cats catch them.
Mechanics: The "catcher" follows your mouse.
Aestetics: Pretty cats and diamonds. They are in a neat looking cave. 
Joys: Getting a cool game to play! and learning about the power of Unity tools. 
Struggles: Having merge conflicts whenever we would both work on the project. Also Unity is a bit overwhelming.

Contributions: It was a pretty back and forth working project. Mark would do something, then Ethan would do something. Mark had to learn how to use gitKraken and work with pushing, pulling, and merging. Ethan helped make sure it was going correctly. Mark would start something and message Ethan what he did, then Ethan would do something and message Mark. On the last day, each member worked on the part they agreed to in class. Overall the project turned out pretty well. Both partners feel like they contributed solid parts to the game. 
Mark - Diamond randomizing/spawning scripts, images over sprites, followmouse scripts
Ethan - Collision detection, score tally, canvas making, sprite connection
